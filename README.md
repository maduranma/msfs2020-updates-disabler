## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if the game stops working properly, installation gets
corrupted or any other problems that might occur.

This program works by blocking a domain in hosts file, so it does NOT
alter nor modify the game code, and also it does not work for
neither does promove piracy.
It would be the equivalent of disconnecting the internet cable while
it's checking for updates.


If Microsoft or any dev of MSFS2020 consider it goes against the EULA or
license, please let me know and I'll inmediately retire it.
